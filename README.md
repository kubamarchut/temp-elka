# Temperature controlling software mock for Warsaw University of Technology Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology lecture halls
Repository for a part of group project made for Methodology of Engineering Design course. Our team's task was to figure out a way to improve student's experience on the campus. Climate discomfort was one of the most often reported issue. We provided a mock of the online shared voting system which results would be automatically applied on the central heating system.
